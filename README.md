This page is auto-generated from a data.js file and populated to the index.html from script.js.
The goal of the the script is to be dynamic and uncaring about the design of the data itself.

Feel free to fork this repository and replace the data.js file with your own.  After you fork then you will need to go into settings and change the repository name to match [username].github.io pattern with username being your github username.

Styling utilizes [Barebones framework](https://acahir.github.io/Barebones/)
